This is the IndexedDb example from http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/indexeddb/todo/, fixed to work on Firefox and with two new functionalities for viewing details data and updating values.
Note: When debugging local files you cannot access indexed db in firefox, in order to work you'll need to host this file to you local IIS or Apache server.
